				<h2> How was the tournament created? </h2>

				<h2> How did the UCL come to be? </h2>
				<p> The name change from the European Cup to the Champions League was purely for Marketing reasons. As of 1992, it took the name by which we know it today because TEAM Marketing AG became its main partner, and the objective they had was to give it another image and innovate in commercial concepts and thereby optimize the value of its rights. </p>
